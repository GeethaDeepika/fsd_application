# AI Powered Web Application for retinal disease detection using transformer models
 
A full-stack web application where users can log in and upload retinal images to predict Glaucoma and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using deep learning models. The system also includes a RAG-based chatbot for medical queries and a feature to generate PDF reports with user and prediction details.

## Project Overview 
This project integrates Machine Learning and Web Development to build a medical diagnostic tool. It allows:

Users to upload fundus images.
. Predict disease status using ViT, Swin Transformer, and Twin Transformer.
. Generate consolidated results using an ensemble of predictions.
. View results in a table format.
. Download diagnosis report as a PDF.
. Chat with a medical assistant powered by LangChain + Gemini.
