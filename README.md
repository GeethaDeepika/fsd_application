# AI Powered Web Application for retinal disease detection using transformer models
 
A full-stack web application where users can log in and upload retinal images to predict Glaucoma and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using deep learning models. The system also includes a RAG-based chatbot for medical queries and a feature to generate PDF reports with user and prediction details.

## Project Overview 
This project integrates Machine Learning and Web Development to build a medical diagnostic tool. It allows:

• Authentication: Signup, login, forgot/reset password with secure backend logic  
• Image Upload: Upload retinal images through a responsive UI  
• Prediction: Ensemble classification using three state-of-the-art models  
• Result Display: Table with results for DR and Glaucoma  
• PDF Report: Generate downloadable report with patient info and predictions  
• Chatbot: Ask questions to a Gemini-based assistant with RAG and vector search
